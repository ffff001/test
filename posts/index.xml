      <description>Something to say Try to use the official minimum mirror installation system, the system provided by VPS merchants may not be good.
Avoid using the root user, try to use a normal user.
Use a firewall and allow only the ports you need.
Follow the principle of least privilege.
Install as little software as possible to meet your own needs.
Use SELinux or AppArmor, if you can.
SSH Without a doubt, this is the most important.</description>

      <description>Something to say When we purchase VPS, the system of VPS is usually provided by the merchant.
But the systems they provide usually have a few glitches. So we&amp;rsquo;re going to replace the system they provide.
I am reluctant to use the popular scripts on the internet to replace the system of the VPS, I like to do it myself.
This method requires the use of VNC, please make sure your VPS merchant offers VNC, usually they will, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry.</description>

      <description>V2Ray History Project V Project V is a set of tools to help you build your own privacy network over internet. The core of Project V, named V2Ray, is responsible for network protocols and communications. It can work alone, as well as combine with other tools.
